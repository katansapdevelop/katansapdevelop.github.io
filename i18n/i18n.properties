httpSection=HTTP
whyHttpSubSection=Why HTTP?
whyHTTPText=Learning the basics of HTTP is hugely important in web development and also equally important in many areas outside of this also.  Before you progress with any of the other topics, please take the time to read and really understand this section.  \n\nThe Mozilla foundation provide some of the best resources available, that help to clearly explain this topic and I pulled some of the key sections on HTTP from their site for you to read. 

xmlSection=XML
whyXmlSubSection=Why XML?
whyXmlText=XML was was at one point going to the saviour of the web and with it's well formedness, provided a way to bring order to the chaos and attempt to create conformity.  In reality this did not quite happen.  XML is somewhat verbose, but still has enough of a presence in the industry to ensure it is worth learning as a topic.  

jsSection=JavaScript
whyjsSubSection=Why JavaScript?
whyjsText=Definitely one of the most popular programming languages at the moment.  JavaScript is way more than just a client side programming language, with fully blown JavaScript engines like Node.js and Rhino in productive use at companies like Netflix, LinkedIn, NASA and Walmart. JavaScript's ability to run asynchronously means it is very well suited for the high volume parallel processing requirements of cloud based computing.  \n\n This is by far the most detailed topic. The content in the references provided, are further subdivided into smaller sections, each with workable examples for you to try.  Please ensure you read the section in full and try out all of the sample code 

restSection=REST
whyRestSubSection=Why REST?
whyRestText=An architectural style for designing and developing web based APIs.  Certainly there has been a shift away from SOAP based models (based on Object Orientated concepts) towards RESTful API development, which is more data centric and better leverages the language of HTTP for simplicity

odataSection=ODATA
whyOdataSubSection=Why ODATA?
whyOdataText=A open source Restful API Standard developed in collaboration with SAP and Microsoft.  Not likely to set the world alight, however will be prominent in Enterprise grade applications as a result of the key collaborators.

openUI5Section=OpenUI5
whyOpenUI5SubSection=Why OpenUI5?
whyOpenUI5Text=An open source JavaScript UI library designed to build responsive apps that support multiple form factors and are enterprise ready.  Has a lot of controls with native integration for services exposed as OData.
